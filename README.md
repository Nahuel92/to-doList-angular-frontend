# To-do List Project (WIP)

This is a hobby project which consists of an Angular frontend for my [REST API project](https://github.com/Nahuel92/to-doList).

I'm a fullstack software developer, that's why I made this project too.

My goals are keep training my frontend skills (in this case, Angular) and provide with an user interface my another hobby project.

## Project Status

- [ ] App Dockerized.
- [x] CRUD operations for a to-do list.
- [x] Integration with my [REST API](https://github.com/Nahuel92/to-doList).
- [x] Toast notification for errors.
- [ ] Unit tests.

## Running the application

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
